# hbplregress R package

Linear regression in R adapted for the Leenaards platform.

It provides:
- simple linear regression, with automatic adaptation of the input dataset (strings changed to factors)
- linear regression performed over several disjoint datasets then, using Bayesian statistics, a means of aggregating the results to provide a global result.

We follow the [coding standards](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html#R-exts) defined by R-CRAN
